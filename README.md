# *Hands on gulpTasks*, branch gulpTasks.

This exercise will expose the basics of pipe line streams, errorcodes and callbacks. 

* [gulp writing a plugin](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin/dealing-with-streams.md)

#### A) Create a new file under /gulpfile.js/tasks/utils, name it *prefixTimestamp.js* 

* Write a gulp plugin in *prefixTimestamp.js* that appends an `@Author` and `@Date` timestamp tags at the begging of each file processed in a JS comment syntax.

```
/** 
 * @Author pablo.molina@netcentric.biz 
 * @Date: 1444042345638
*/ 
```

* Write a *'postJS'* task that gets all files generated by webpack target folder publish/javascripts and pipes such files through the newly created plugin, at the end, the files should also reside in publish/javascripts but contain the timestamp and author tags in a JS comment. Note the plugin should also produce some logs of the file being processed.
